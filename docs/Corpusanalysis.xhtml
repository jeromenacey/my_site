        <p>This is my submission page for the assignment due October 28, 2021. Organize Text
            Comparison Sets for the Corpus Analysis</p>
        <p>1. Upload your text file or files into Voyant tools and get a sense of the predominant
            words used. Look at the word cloud and the data on the most the most frequently used
            words. You can open a new browser window to Voyant and arrange your web browser windows
            to look at the Voyant views of your two text collections side-by-side. How do your two
            sets of texts compare with each other for most frequent word use? Are there particular
            words of interest that stand out in one set vs. the other? Take screen captures of the
            word clouds and other data from Voyant tools that you find relevant for comparison. </p>
        <p>a. The two text’s most frequently used words are very similar as they both have music as
            one of their top 5 words. The battle for health’s texts also includes voice, while the
            bell telephone text includes the word sound. While these two words are not the same,
            they are similar with the word music in the fact that they are related to sound
            production or are something you hear. There are also people’s names that appear as some
            of the most frequently used words. Battle for health being Smith, and Haggard; and bell
            telephone being Bell, and Watson.</p>

        <p>2. Next, explore Keywords in Context (KWIC) information: Choose some interesting word or
            phrase to survey how it is used, scoping 5 to 10 words to the left and right of the word
            or phrase. You can view this in Voyant or Antconc.</p>
        <p>a. From Antconc, a few interesting n-grams that I found in the bell telephone text were
            “music under narrator”, “a piece of”, and “piece of wire”. Some interesting n-grams that
            I found in the battle for health text were “tag in and”, “anopheles u u”, and “in New
            York”. For the “music under narrator” text in Bell telephone, when looking at the words
            leading up to, and following this n-gram, I can tell that the “music under” part was an
            order to the band playing, while the “narrator” part was to let the narrator of this
            story know what it is to say, and when to start talking. With the “a piece of”, and
            “piece of wire” text groups, they are both showing up the same amount because they lead
            into each other, as the whole phrase is “a piece of wire”. What this is talking about is
            the start of the telephone because the phrase “a piece of wire” is preceded and
            proceeded by talking about two men and how a piece of wire, and some faith was what
            started the telephone. In battle for health, the phrase “tag in and” is surrounded by
            wording that shows that this is something to do with how the music is brought into the
            story, “anopheles u u” are simply more instructions to follow for the reader to know
            what the writer is intending to say. “In New York” is said frequently due to this being
            set in New York, and some announcer is frequently saying this in the text due to several
            different occurrences happening. One being about health officials, another about the
            Wartime Public Health Conference, and another being the setting and the date, which is
            1864. What can be inferred from these surrounding phrases is that this story is clearly
            in the past, but is also during a war that the U.S. is in.</p>
        <p>3. Can you see something of the distribution of an interesting word particle or phrase in
            Voyant or the Concordance view in Antconc? Does this provide something interesting to
            compare in your comparison set of texts?</p>
        <p>a. What I’ve noticed about the distribution of interesting words is that they both say
            the main character’s, or characters’, name frequently showing that both texts are told
            in the third person. I also noticed that the orders for the narrator, or orders for the
            musicians in both texts appear as some of the most frequently used words and phrases as
            well. This does not give much to compare due to the Bell telephone’s text having mostly
            musical instructions, while the battle for health text uses mostly instructions for the
            narrator to follow.</p>
