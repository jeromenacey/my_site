        <p>This is my submission page for the assignment due October 19, 2021.
            Organize Text Comparison Sets for the Corpus Analysis</p>
        <p>1.	Explain what documents or document collections you are working with.
            a.	The documents or document collections that I will be working with are War and Peace, as well as War of the Worlds
            2.	Post at least two screen captures here from the text analysis tools (for each text, or group of texts) that suggest to you there might be something interesting to compare or contrast.
            a.	War and Peace results
        </p>

                <p>3a. This is a picture of AntConc’s results after analyzing the War and Peace text.
                    As you can see, there is a lot of n-grams that have something to do with not 
                    doing something. Also, the 6th most popular n-gram is commander in chief, 
                    this make sense as this text is most likely about wartime. 
                    What I also noticed was the 12th most popular n-gram is “the old prince”; 
                    this suggests that this book was written or is written about a time where 
                    royalty was more common as the royal family would also have a lot to do with
                    the war and peace of the people they ruled.</p>

        <p>2b. War of the Worlds results</p>

                <p>3b. This is a picture of AntConc’s results after analyzing the War of the Worlds
                    text. Looking at all the results, it is clearly noticeable that this is a 
                    science-fiction piece of literature, the third most popular n-gram is
                    “of the Martians”. Looking at the most popular n-gram “out of the”, 
                    someone analyzing this without knowing what they were looking at could
                    possibly assume that it is kind of mysterious. “What is coming out of where”,
                    not an n-gram, but could be a thought when looking at the analysis results,
                    which lends itself to have a bit of a mysterious tone. </p>
