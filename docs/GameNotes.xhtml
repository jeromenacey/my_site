        <p>The pictures taken from this game are at the bottom of this page, after the game
            notes</p>
        <p>Choose your game and write a first draft of notes on the game play. Take notes on the
            following:</p>
        <p>Question:Look and listen in the game: What features (or assets) are helping to create an
            illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and media?</p>
        <p>1. The features of the game that create the illusion of exploring the virtual world is
            that the player controls a game character that travels between 5 different settings, and
            at each setting the character can walk around and explore the different settings. The
            graphics and media aren’t too bad, they aren’t as simple as just shapes that move like
            some video games, however, they aren’t crazy in the sense that they are super realistic,
            or the animation is very accurate to real life. </p>
        <p>Question:How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and
            what makes the settings distinctive?</p>
        <p>2. The settings in the game are simple, but the angle at which the player views their
            character change, between an overhead shot, to a shot that is watching them at eye
            level, depending on which setting of the game you are in. There isn’t much to explore,
            just 5 different parts, and each part is small, the whole area fits on the screen and
            only one moves to show the character traveling farther than what can be shown in one
            spot. The settings are distinctive because they are different. Two remind me of a
            desert, two remind me of a forest, and one seems to be like a mountain top. </p>
        <p>Question:What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be
            multiple characters? Or just one character type?</p>
        <p>3. You can only control one character, you are unable to change characters, and you
            aren’t able to customize your character either. </p>
        <p>Question:How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them
            distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc?</p>
        <p>4. You get to know the character you are playing by having them interact with the other
            NPC characters, but the main character you are playing doesn’t reply, just interacts.
            The character is kind of quirky in the fact that he looks like an explorer. </p>
        <p>Question:What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters?</p>
        <p>5. The kind of interactions I have with the NPC characters are that they talk to me when
            I press E, if they have me do a task, the speech bubble is red, if they are just talking
            to me about something that isn’t important to finishing the game, the speech bubble is
            black. </p>
        <p>Question:How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked
            to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the game?</p>
        <p>6. The challenge that I found was that you had to have the task given to you before
            completing them, and sometimes getting the object to give to the other characters was a
            little tricky at times. I must try and find all the missing objects and give them to
            their owners so that the owners would be happy. I didn’t really get stuck anywhere,
            making progress was done by finding and returning the three missing items to their
            respective owners. </p>
        <p>Question:What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written
            messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up functional things
            you need to get other things work?</p>
        <p>7. The objects that are interacted with are a sail-back, which looks like a dinosaur, a
            shield for a robot, and food for a monk. There aren’t any messages that are picked up,
            but there are messages that are given verbally that you must remember, but they aren’t
            important in finishing the game. Food is not consumed by the character you’re playing;
            nothing is picked up that is needed to make other things work.</p>
        <p>Question:Where (if ever) do you see the game comment on itself in a meta way as a
            fictional, constructed system (as a game)?</p>
        <p>8. The game comments on itself by way of one of the NPC’s telling you to feel free to
            explore the place. </p>
        <p>Question:Where and how do you see the game respond to or comment on our reality? Or what
            cultural issues from our world do you see reflected in this game?</p>
        <p>9. I don’t see any way that this game could comment on reality, nor do I see any cultural
            issues that are reflected in the game. </p>
        <p>Question:Speculate: How could this game develop in the future, or what would be an
            improvement the developers could make in a next stage?</p>
        <p>10. This game could be done, but has plenty of room to go, more areas, more tasks, more
            explanations, or stories by the NPC’s. Also, there is a weird cone shaped thing that the
            character is never able to figure out what it is, even after finishing all the tasks.
            The game has a story but seems like it was never finished to what the story tries to
            tell. </p>
