        <p>This is some of the only digital artwork I've made. It was all done using Photoshop
            during my very first semester at Behrend. These were submissions for homework
            assignments in class.</p>

                <p>This is a picture of one of my dogs, Hobbes, with some creative liberties taken
                    during photoshop. I combined four different photos into this showing I knew how
                    to use different parts of Photoshop to shade, dim, resize, and recolor
                    photos.</p>

                <p>This was just a couple of pictures I found online that I combined. What we had
                    learned in class was how to draw on pictures, that is why there is a divider
                    between the two sides. I was showing I knew how to change the color of the
                    marker, as well as the size, and how to use it.</p>

                <p>The above picture was just a homework assignment that I used my vehicle in to
                    make a background for my laptop with because I thought it looked cool.</p>
